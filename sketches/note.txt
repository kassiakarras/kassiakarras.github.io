Hey,

Sorry, this took so long. 

These are really rough sketches of the look. I have little notes scattered around, but basically, I was thinking that the look of the website could be super clean and minimalistic. Since my art is so wild, it would contrast well with a clean look. 

I am also really drawn to the idea of primary colors (red x yellow x blue). 

As for the background, I have included two jpegs of bears, and I thought they would make for a fun background (in pattern form). 

I attached a draft logo.

 I also attached some pictures to stick into the slideshow


If there's anything that's unclear (which there probably is), I can sketch out more ideas. This is just a jumping off point!
